# School District Analysis
## Overview
In our original analysis, we prepared available standardized data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insghts about peformance trends and patterns.
Our primary focus was: How does student funding , student body size, and school type affect standardzed testing scores? And how do these scores vary from grade level to grade level?
Our original analysis, however, required some modifications when it was revealed there was evidence of acadmeic dishonesty in the data, specifically with 9th grade test scores from Thomas High School. We were tasked with replacing those test scores and running our original analysis with our new data.
This analysis will play a role in the school district's decision making regarding district spending and priorities.
