# School District Analysis
## Overview
In our original analysis, we prepared available standardized data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insghts about peformance trends and patterns.
Our primary focus was: How does student funding , student body size, and school type affect standardzed testing scores? And how do these scores vary from grade level to grade level?
Our original analysis, however, required some modifications when it was revealed there was evidence of acadmeic dishonesty in the data, specifically with 9th grade test scores from Thomas High School. We were tasked with replacing those test scores and running our original analysis with our new data.
This analysis will play a role in the school district's decision making regarding district spending and priorities.

## Results
### How was the district summary affected?

* You can see the student count and the budget remained the same between the two analyses. While we removed the tests scores from the freshman at THS, we still will include them for this particular bit of data. Because those students' scores were removed, however, they were not counted when analyzing the results of their tests, which is where you see the difference between the modified and original data sets. The scores in the modified set are lower than they are in the original by fractions of a percent.

* You can see that for the most part the school summary went unaffected. That is expected, as in this summary we are breaking down results school by school, and results from Thomas High School wouldn't affect the scores of, say, Griffin High School. The only scores that would be affected in this summary would only be those specific to Thomas High School.
### How did replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

* When comparing the top performing schools in the district you can see Thomas High School's spot remained unchanged. Their overall passing percentage dropped by about 0.3% but it wasn't enough to drop them from the number 2 spot. 
### How did replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
#### Math and reading scores by grade
* This was only affected because THS's reading and math scores for freshman were removed. Removing freshman scores should not have an effect on the scores of sophomores, juniors, and seniors
#### Scores by school spending
* Looking at the data, rounding to 1 decimal place, the original and modified data sets yielded the same results for scores by school spending. Meaning, if there was an affect, it wasn't very significant.
#### Scores by school size
* 
#### Scores by school type

## Summary
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
